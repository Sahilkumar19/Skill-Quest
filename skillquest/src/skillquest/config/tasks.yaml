categorization:
  description: |
    Strictly analyze if the question relates to Data Science, ML, DL, AI or Python Programming. 
    If not, categorize as Irrelevant. Only use other categories for:
    - Data Science: Statistics, Analytics, Data Modeling
    - Machine Learning: Algorithms, Training, Predictions
    - Deep Learning: Neural Networks, Computer Vision, NLP
    - AI: Reasoning, Problem Solving, Intelligent Systems
    - Python Programming: Libraries, Syntax, code debugging, etc.

    Common Irrelevant Topics:
    - General programming (non-python)
    - Web/App development
    - Hardware/Networking
    - Non-technical subjects
    - Personal advice
    - Career guidance
    - General knowledge queries

    Question: {question}
    History: {history}

    Categorization Steps:
    1. Check if question mentions DS/ML/DL/AI terms
    2. Verify technical relevance to data workflows
    3. If uncertain, mark Irrelevant
    4. Only proceed with categories below if strictly relevant

    Categories:
    - Irrelevant: Not DS/ML/DL/AI related
    - Definition-Based: Terminology explanations
    - Concept-Explanation: Theory/architecture breakdowns
    - Problem-Solving: Algorithmic solutions
    - Comparison: Technique/model contrasts
    - Process-Guide: Data pipeline guidance
    - Doubt-Clearing: Conceptual misunderstandings
    - Python-Code: Data science implementations
    - Python-Debug: ML code troubleshooting
